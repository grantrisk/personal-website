# Personal Project

This project is a personal website featuring my blogs and video references to my YouTube channel. It is built using Next.js, a framework for building server-rendered React applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/grantrisk/personal-website.git
cd personal-project
npm install
```

Then, you can start the development server with:


```
npm run dev
```

This will start a development server at http://localhost:3000, where you can view the website.

## Features

* YouTube Videos: You can find the list of all my YouTube videos on the video page.
* Responsive Design: The website is designed to look good on any screen size.
